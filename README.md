# Hey, Devesh here ðŸ‘‹

![About Me](Intro.jpg)

I'm a Web Developer by both passion and profession, at the same time, I am learning new things everyday and am a forever learner. I am passionate about solving problems and building things from the ground up. I'm currently also pursuing my Computer Science degree alongside working at Startups for learning and lots of fun.

I'm currently working with the MERN Stack and occasionally with Firebase as well. I am also proficient in the LAMP Stack and continue to learn everything that catches my eye.
