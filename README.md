# Hey, Devesh here 👋

![About Me](https://github.com/deve-sh/deve-sh/raw/master/Intro.jpg)

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer, by both passion and profession. I build web apps and architect systems. I reverse engineer tools I use day to day and write scripts that make everyone's life easy.

Every now and then, you'll see me writing a [blog post](https://blog.devesh.tech), documenting my learnings or reading something interesting (I have more books than I could possibly read). If you can't find me doing any of the above, I'll probably be outside on a drive.
